# ZUBAAN

Our platform focuses primarily on animal welfare, as stated in our slogan, BE KIND TO ALL KINDS. When an accident involving a stray animal occurs, people can tap a button on our app, which will share the location of the area where the animal is, and the rescue team will immediately arrive. We are trying to make it hassle-free so even a busy one can help, with immediate rescue by animal welfare and veterinary doctors at various stops throughout the city. Our Ani Band Device, an intelligent collar for animals with lots of functionalities, can also collaborate with the government's forest department and animal welfare department to rescue wild animals. 



# Ml Tech Used :
Its prediction model is based on CNN using sigmoid and Relu functions; the test accuracy is 100% which is not correct because we used a custom dataset we are trying to gather more reliable data as of now.

Our Model Will work on two-parameter : 
To predict the Health Status of the Animal by using data on its, Temperature Heart Rate and Oxygen Level.
To determine the safety of animals by staying away from moving cars on the road using ultrasonic sensor data.

# Ani - Band : 
The band is attached around the animal's paws or legs and takes temperature and health readings. We are now working on an app that will be directly connected to the band and will provide a regular update of its health. We are carefully considering a big potential to work with the Indian Forest Department and the Animal Welfare Department in order to make the band reach a larger sector of animals all around the country than only pets, rather than merely concentrating on the 1% of the country's specialist sector which will in turn help in monitoring animal's health status.We can tie those bands to cattle by working with the Indian animal welfare board to connect them with farmers who raise cattle.  This would guarantee that farmers keep a close eye on their cattle's health and are able to identify any problems or signs of illness well in advance.
